The Project **ACTIVELY LEARNING with practices** created by *Yours Sincerely* during my study of the *MDNWebDocs Markdown* on becoming a Frontend Engineer at *<https://developer.mozilla.org/>* **MOZILLA DEVELOPER NETWORK** on *my quest for knowledge*

## Technologies

* HTML for markup
* CSS for styling and more

* IMG for holding all needed images
* README: the markdown file attached to the root of the repo.
